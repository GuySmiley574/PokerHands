Poker Hands
RESTful API written in C#

Can be run in VS2022 or by running ..\PokerHands\bin\Debug\net6.0\PokerHands.exe and navigating a browser to https://localhost:5001/api/pokergame

There is no front end to speak of as I haven't the experience in web programming. The browser refresh will display a new game.
The Api only has a Get for this same reason.

PokerGameController provides mechanisms for adding players and stacking the hands.
